# Hybrid LSTM + Informer for Daily Time-Series Forecasting

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementing a **hybrid model combining LSTM and Informer** for daily time-series forecasting.  
The model leverages the sequential learning capabilities of LSTMs with the long-range dependency handling power of the Informer architecture.

## 📊 Key Features
- Combines **LSTM** (good for short-term patterns) and **Informer** (efficient for long-term forecasting).
- Designed for **daily time-series data** such as stock prices or energy demand.
- Customizable architecture for different datasets.
- Easy to modify and extend.

## 📝 Notebook
- `lstm-and-informer-hybrid-daily.ipynb`: Full implementation with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 🚀 Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries (`pytorch`, `transformers`, `sklearn`, etc.).
3. Open the notebook and run all cells.
